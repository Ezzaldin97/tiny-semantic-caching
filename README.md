## Description:

Semantic Caching is an In-Memory Database that support Semantic Search (Vector Search), it can be used in many different applications like RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), Database Assistant, and many more..
Designing a high performance applications that uses LLMs requires handling alot of issues like Time-Complexity, and avoidance of repeatable calls.
Semantic Caching can help and save time and computational resources when designing applications like this.
Tiny Semantic Caching is a project that uses Ollama and Vector Search in Duckdb to create complete semantic caching cycle.
